            <li>
                <h3>Hey everyone!</h3> </br>
<p>

    I’m Khalid Azmatullah, a college student with a passion for tech and a never-ending pile of textbooks. Over the past two weeks, I embarked on a journey that many of you might find both exciting and challenging: I built my very own website from scratch! It was an intense, rewarding experience that taught me a lot about web development and even more about balancing my academic life with personal projects. I wanted to share how I managed to pull this off in such a short time frame while keeping up with my studies.
    </p>
</br>
   <h3> Week 1: Diving In </h3> </br>
  <p>  <strong>Day 1-2</strong>: Planning and Research,
    
    The first couple of days were all about planning. I knew I wanted to create a portfolio website to showcase my projects and skills. I spent time researching different website builders and coding languages. After weighing the pros and cons, I decided to use HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. Why? Because it’s a great learning experience, and I wanted full control over the design and functionality.
  </br>
</br>
    <strong>Day 3-4</strong>: Learning the Basics,
    
    Next up, I brushed up on my coding skills. I revisited some online tutorials and used resources like W3Schools and MDN Web Docs. Balancing this with my study schedule was tricky. I found that dedicating a couple of hours in the evening after classes was the best approach. It meant staying up a bit later than usual, but it was worth it for the progress I made.
</br><br>
   <strong>Day 5-7</strong>: Starting the Build,
    
    With the basics down, I started building the site. I set clear goals for each day: Day 1 was the homepage layout, Day 2 was adding the navigation bar, and so on. To manage my time effectively, I used a Pomodoro timer to work in focused 25-minute intervals with 5-minute breaks. This method helped me stay productive without burning out.
    <br><br><br>
  <h3>  Week 2: Enhancing and Finalizing</h3><br>
    <strong>Day 8-10</strong>: Adding Content and Style,
    
    By the start of the second week, I had the basic structure in place. Now it was time to make it look good. I dove into CSS, experimenting with different styles and layouts. I spent a lot of time tweaking colors, fonts, and spacing. During this phase, I found it helpful to take short breaks and return with fresh eyes to spot issues I might have missed.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Day 11-12</strong>: JavaScript and Functionality,
    
    With the design sorted, I added some interactive elements using JavaScript. This included a form for contact details and a dynamic project gallery. Balancing this with studying for my upcoming exams required some serious multitasking. I used study breaks to work on coding, and vice versa. It was a juggling act, but it kept me engaged and prevented burnout.
    <br> <br>
    <strong>Day 13-14</strong>: Testing and Launch,
    



    The final stretch was all about testing and debugging. I spent these days checking for bugs, ensuring compatibility across different browsers, and making final adjustments. Launching the site felt like a huge accomplishment. To celebrate, I treated myself to a well-deserved break with friends.

      <br>
  <p>    
<br>
    <strong>In the end</strong>, building a website in just two weeks while managing my studies was challenging but incredibly rewarding. It taught me a lot about time management, coding, and perseverance. If you’re considering a similar project, my advice is to go for it—just plan carefully and stay committed.
