Today I celebrate 100+ commits and deployments of my website and the successful Blog #002 Release.
However a pressing issue has been the lack of support and multiple bugs found when operating on mobile.

I shall address these issues, but for now the website well and going!
I might have to remove my number from contacts so as to protect my privacy but for now it can be as it is.

I will create a specific blog page in future but It's not necessary right now.
